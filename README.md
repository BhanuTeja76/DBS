This repository contains a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application for a login and password reset system. It includes the following features:

User Login: Allows users to log in with a username and password.
Forgot Password: Provides an option to reset the password by sending a verification code to the user's email.
Verification Code: Validates the user's identity by requiring a code sent to the registered email.
Password Reset: Allows users to set a new password with security validations (minimum 8 characters, with at least one letter, one number, and one special character).

Note: sample application created for my assignment used further to deploy it in the cloud server and will automate it by CI & CD pipeline
